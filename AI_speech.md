# chat bot in CentOS

In this trial, I apply the japanese speech synthesis engine(OpenJtalk) in a chat bot whose replys generated by DNN. In this way, the bot could response to the complain by voice.

Since framwork TensorFlow has been used in the bot's scripts and the program is going to be put on a server(CentOS), first of all I need make the development environment work. 
Here is the tools I need at least:

CentOS
------------------------------
Python
TensorFlow
other modules for Python
------------------------------
OpenJtalk(HTS engine,voice model,source voice ,dictionary files)

I divided these in to three parts.Thus the manual consists of three parts.  I would share the experience of installation for the corresponding tools.

## Part 1

Preperation for openjtalk coding.
Before the coding, we need to install some SDK. 

- install the engine (open-jtalk)

$sudo apt-get install open-jtalk open-jtalk-mecab-naist-jdic hts-voice-nitech-jp-atr503-m001

- download the voice file(zip)

$wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/mmdagent/files/MMDAgent_Example/MMDAgent_Example-1.6/MMDAgent_Example-1.6.zip/download -O MMDAgent_Example-1.6.zip

- unzip the voice file

$unzip MMDAgent_Example-1.6.zip MMDAgent_Example-1.6/Voice/*

$sudo cp -r MMDAgent_Example-1.6/Voice/mei/ /usr/share/hts-voice

with the SDK above you have enough material to build a simple speech synthesis program.
As for the code sourse, please check the file "test.py" in the same folder. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Part 2

 Simple manual for the setup for VScode to Github.

 In the beginning,let's "cd" to get in the directory where the files there you want to upload and update

- initiate a git in this folder

$git init

- address this folder to the project in Github(replace the address with your address in github)

$git remote add origin https://github.com/......../....git


When upload,go into the same folder

- select all the files in this folder

$git add .  

or use $git add "filename" to select a single file  
when use "visual studio code"'s git, press the "+"button to add/select the file, and do not! not! not! use the commit button function in VScode )

- commit the selected file(do input this command in console)

$git commit -m "comment"  

- upload the files to the git

$git push origin master 

# Options

$git pull origin master (update the current files from your github)  

$git status (confirm the current status)

## Acknowledgements

I want thank Mr.honma for the help in connecting the VScode to Github.
And thank your for finishing the reading and for the overlooking of my poor grammar lol.
